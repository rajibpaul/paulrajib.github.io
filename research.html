                        <p>Sixth-generation (6G) networks are considered a successor to 5G networks, and it is expected that 6G will be commercially available in 2030. It is expected that 6G will bring intelligence from centralized computing facilities to end terminals, thereby providing concrete implementation to distributed learning models studied from a theoretical point of view in a 5G context. 
                            Several computational tasks like sensing, communicating, and performing in the local environment appear on the terminal devices. Integration of cloud computing and mobile computing raises mobile cloud computing (MCC). Making real-time and reliable interference at the network edge requires new network architectures and their associated communication-efficient training algorithms over wireless links. The aforesaid appeal brings the existence of edge computing, or mobile edge computing (MEC), that extends the computing services to the edge of networks leveraging base stations.</p>

                <div class="research-content">
                    <div class="research-description">
                        <p>V2X is expected to support various services such as collision prevention, autonomous
                            driving, and remote driving, and some of these services require improved communication performance such as
                            high reliability, low latency, and high throughput. Semi-persistent scheduling (SPS) is used for periodic data
                            transfer among the resource management methods in C-V2X after processing the data by using time series
                            classification.</p>
                            
                        <p>According to C-V2X SPS is a method that includes both mode-3 and mode-4. In
                            mode-3, resource allocation is supported by the base station, whereas in mode-4,
                            the vehicles make autonomous decisions. Each vehicle identifies the surrounding channel condition and
                            requests the base station to assign resources for transmitting data. Since
                            the topology changes in real-time due to high mobility, which is the most critical
                            feature of V2X, it is crucial to collect the data at the base station and determine
                            resources within a limited time. Therefore, each vehicle requests SPS
                            resources at random times, and the intention is to advance this randomized method of
                            SPS protocol. The architecture of the SPS protocol allows a base station to reject any resource request by vehicles. Therefore,
                            the efficiency of resource allocation depends on global optimized random access. The aim of this study is to achieve high reliability and low latency requirements through a random-access
                            algorithm using deep neural network reinforcement learning.</p>

                        <p>Time division multiple access (TDMA) is recognized as a well-established concept in communications for dividing access 
                            into time slots. This technique is regarded as particularly promising for optimizing edge computing processes in wireless environments.
                            The immediate focus will be on the improvement of resource allocation through the optimization of TDMA scheduling. By considering real-time 
                            traffic and device requirements, an adaptive scheduling mechanism capable of dynamically adjusting time slots is proposed. The goals are set to 
                            include the reduction of energy consumption and latency for edge users while quality of service (QoS) is maintained. In centralized architectures, 
                            overhead and energy consumption at the edge are expected to be reduced. Decentralization of this prediction task among edge devices (e.g., Edge AI) 
                            is being considered to ensure data integrity and confidentiality. Long-term objectives are defined to address scalability challenges anticipated 
                            in the 6G era, which are caused by ultra-high device density, massive data generation, and diverse application demands. Consequently, a 
                            TDMA-based edge computing architecture designed to scale according to 6G network demands will be developed.
                            Integration of TDMA with technologies such as MIMO, millimeter wave, and beamforming is planned to enhance edge computing performance. 
                            The motivation lies in the creation of an edge computing network capable of supporting next-generation applications, including autonomous vehicles, 
                            smart cities, and patient monitoring systems.</p>
